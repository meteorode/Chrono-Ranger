# chrono_cross.py

# Themes:
#   1.  A game about history and predestination.
#   2.  Leading/witnessing humanity to different destinies by triggering/changing history events.

# Features:
#   1.  Shuffle/Play your own deck into linear history events.
#   2.  Click an event card to resolve it
#   3.  Roll dice to resolve events.
#   4.  While resolved a card, check special match-3 rules(i.e, [Char, Location, Story] with same color
#       would trigger new effects).
